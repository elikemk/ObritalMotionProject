This project simulates Venus’s orbit using Kepler’s Laws and Newtonian mechanics. We computed gravitational forces, updated velocity and position iteratively, and verified the elliptical orbit by analyzing perihelion and aphelion. Results confirm Venus follows Kepler’s Laws, moving faster near the Sun. The simulation code and visualizations are available in this repository.
